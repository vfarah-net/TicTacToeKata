# TicTacToeKata
TicTacToeKata is all about having fun with TDD or BDD, SOLID and is enspired by the Codurance ideology of trying to strive to be a master craftsman

# Simple rules
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe for defining your domain rules and possible strategies
Players can't play on a played position
There can only be two players and they alternate goes
0 always goes first

# Definition of Done
TDD or BDD for testing structure
SOLID principles or clean code principles must always be applied
KISS
NO DRY or Anti patterns, at least on the second version
NO Comments or little ideally
Create unit test to prove all the scenarios
Create either a console app, windows forms or web app to use the lib to demonstrate (No need to test this, just to visually display an interact with your library)
