# TicTacToeKata
TicTacToeKata is all about having fun with TDD or BDD, SOLID and is inspired by the Codurance ideology of trying to strive to be a master craftsman

# Simple rules
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe for defining your domain rules and possible strategies
* Players can't play on a played position
* There can only be two players and they alternate goes
* 0 always goes first

# Definition of Done
* TDD or BDD for testing structure
* SOLID principles or clean code principles must always be applied
* KISS
* NO DRY or Anti patterns, at least on the second version
* NO Comments or little ideally
* Create unit test to prove all the scenarios
* Create either a console app, windows forms or web app to use the lib to demonstrate (No need to test this, just to visually display an interact with your library)

# TODO
* Refactor UI to cater for ViewModel
* Generate ViewModel Base with commands
* Generate commands to support actions
* Create tests for the view model
